# Work In Progress 🏗

Hi DaCodes and DD3. 👨🏻‍💻

While I was reading the task I was thinking about the multiple ways I can solve it and I couldn't stop asking myself what would be the best solution.
So I decide to give my 110% and solve this problem in the different ways I though. All the code in this repository is created by myself.

I hope you get satisfied with my solution(s).
